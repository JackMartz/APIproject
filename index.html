<!-- I'll probably tinker with this after leaving 1150 since this is something I am somewhat interested in that is also a summation of our lessons thus far and will be a great example in the future for something I have created if i continue to work on it -->
<!-- Planned later additions -->
<!-- 
    Make evolution not just a p tag, but also an on click fetch of that pokemon
    Make return information collapsable
    Include all forms
 -->

<!-- further thought has led me to believe that perhaps utilizing text field input at the current time would be an overcomplication that i can try and add if time allows. For the meantime I will just proceed as previously intended with the limit set to 251 with all being displayed. If this starts to fail then I will troubleshoot tomorrow. -->


 <!-- If Timecrunch hits -->
 <!-- make return i with i++ -->
